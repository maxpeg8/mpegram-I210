## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project is about the Los Cinco Pintores "The Five Artists". It was a group of 5 artists from the Sante Fe area in the early 1920's that created and promoted art through local and traveling exhibitions. I chose this after being intrigued by a painting of a Pueblo Indian from Taos, some 70 miles south of Santa Fe.

### Core Webpages

My core webpages will feature a gallery and a specific page for each of the group members. The gallery will be headlined by some of the major artworks created by the group and by clicking on any artwork image you can see a description of the piece. The member pages will feature an about section and a mini gallery showing off some of the works they created. Lastly, a page that is a map with different points at the different places where either notable works of theirs were created or the different places they had exhibitions.

### Design Choices

My choices for colors will be inspired by the official color scheme for the city of Sante Fe, NM.
Colors: #3E3E3E, #F9C647, #BFD8D2, #EF4136
Blue will be the background color
Reb will be the secondary text color
Gray will be the primary text color
Yellow will be the accent color
